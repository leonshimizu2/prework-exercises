My name is Babe Ruth. I've been playing professional baseball for the past 
number of years, but I'm finding that I've reached the top of the career 
ladder in my field. I'm looking to transition into a position in web development, 
because I find that it's a career in which I can truly express my creativity. 
I was always interested in coding, but was never able to get into it because 
computers haven't been invented yet. This is my chance to finally jump into it, 
and hopefully land a job at my dream company: MySpace.
